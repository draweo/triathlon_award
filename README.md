Triathlon award (AKA award.py) was a task on my HyperionDev Bootcamp.

The task was to code a programme that allowed Triathlon participants to input their time for each stage of the race.

The programme should then collate those times and output a level of award (if applicable, based on their time) using pre-defined parameters.

This may sound silly to experienced coders, but this was **an exciting moment in my coding journey**, when the code all worked as I had intended!
